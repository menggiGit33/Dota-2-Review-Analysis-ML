Every hero here is unique - each has their own abilities, play style and role in the team. I especially liked how important it is not just to play well for your character, but to understand how to interact with others. Every match is a new story, where everything depends on your decisions and tactics.

Of course, it wasn't easy to get used to it. At first I got beaten a lot, and sometimes it was frustrating because of the toxicity of some of the players. But over time, as I started to understand the mechanics, pick strategies and win, Dota 2 started to be a real pleasure.

POSITIVES:
Dota has a healthy competitive scene, good character design, interesting character backstories, and engaging events. It also boasts one of the largest prize pools in competitive gaming, which encourages high level professional gameplay that is entertaining to watch. Dota also has a very responsive report system for toxicity, improper play, and cheating, and provides feedback to the player that submitted the report. As well, it has a more positive system of commending players who were kind or played well. The matchmaking attempts to group players with similar ""behavior scores"" so that people who are consistently kind and play well can play with others who do the same.

NEGATIVES:
Dota has a very high skill floor for online matches at any rank. To be sufficiently prepared for your first online match, I recommend playing against computers until you can consistently beat the highest difficulty, or about 30-50 hours of matches. Even then, you will still likely lose your first few games. It's much easier to learn with an experienced teammate in a voice call, so they can teach you in real time and support your ideas for plays. If you're attempting to learn on your own, consider watching guide channels on youtube, especially for characters you want to learn. Another difficulty with picking up Dota, is that after your first 100 hours worth of online matches you unlock ranked play, and will likely be placed in Herald (the lowest rank). It is exceedingly difficulty to escape the low ranks, as without a proper team on your side you will often be paired with teams that will stop you from winning, either by lack of skill, or by intentional disruption.

TL;DR:
You should give Dota a try. It's significantly better with friends, but you can play alone as well, and if you don't like it, it's free, so it cost you nothing but time.",True,58246,3032,1737771304,False,3,0,0

76561198129663301,186169960,"Ah, Dota 2! A masterclass in community-driven gameplay, where every match feels like a team-building retreat hosted by life coaches. Teammates are paragons of patience and understanding, always eager to gently guide you through your mistakes. Pick the wrong hero? No problem! They’ll respond with warm, constructive feedback like, “Wow, what a bold choice! Let’s see how we can make this work!” Truly inspiring.

The way everyone rallies together in tough situations is nothing short of heartwarming. Your mid-laner, instead of silently fuming after losing their lane, will enthusiastically type out a motivational speech about overcoming adversity. Meanwhile, your carry, rather than grumbling about bad support, will kindly say, “Don’t worry, you’re doing great! Keep it up, champ!” It's like therapy, but free.

And the pings? Oh, the pings! They're not passive-aggressive Morse code messages of frustration. Nope. They’re loving nudges to remind you where you might improve. When your entire screen lights up with that familiar Ding! Ding! Ding! sound, you know your team is just looking out for you, making sure you don’t miss out on valuable learning opportunities.

The cherry on top is the post-match experience. Whether you win or lose, the camaraderie spills over into all-chat, where everyone exchanges heartfelt compliments. “GG EZ,” of course, is shorthand for “Good Game, Excellent Zeal.” And when someone tells you to uninstall, it’s clearly their quirky way of saying, “Take a break and come back stronger.”

So, to anyone seeking a game where teamwork, kindness, and good vibes are the norm, I can’t recommend Dota 2 enough. It’s practically a self-help program disguised as a MOBA. You’ll leave every match feeling like a better, more enlightened version of yourself.

76561198331258290,186163782,"Worst game ever for me. At the beginning it sucks cuz you don't know a thing about gameplay, [b]tutorial is useless[/b]. It doesn't give you a clue about roles, heroes, timings etc, you should discover it by yourself. However if u queue, probably first 200 games ur score will be like 1 15 and everyones will blame you. 

After this hell full of ignoracne, you will have enough knowledge to play good or at least you would think so. And here comes the second, actually the worst thing about dota - [b]community[/b]. Dota players could be offended so ez, literally from a one move and won't play with you till the last second of the game. They are mostly so toxic, racist and sexist. The worst part of it is that you start to copy these habits and every session can make you a bit worse. Sure, it depends  on your personality, but it's my experience. 70 % percents - russians, half of them are re***ded middle age nobodies who login to play 2-3 games in alcoholic intoxication, they don't give a shit about the game, win or lose, they just press spells and items randomly, another - 15 years old nazi who blame you because of reluctance to talk their language.  Even if you will have allmute, it's always so hard to play as team, in the long run, impossible to win consistently.

[b]Ranked system[/b] is awkward. After a win streak you wil have either a support hero on a core role or a player who will go 0 10 or smth. And it's always the same, you must tryhard, there is no place for you to mistake. But when you do - this feeling hurts a lot. You think ""why me? I only want to fucking win. Why do I have this ..."" and so on. You q next, get the same, get angry, make more mistakes, lose. 

However in theory [b]gameplay is good[/b] in this game. So much spells, heroes, items, builds, drafts. Every game is unique. Every hero is unique. You can combo abilities, counter enemies' draft, group up to take objectives or enemy hero, make strategies etc.

Anyways, I miss the time spent on this game. Strongly don't recommend it. Today I uninstall it and hope won't come back.",False,179632,3560,1737563453,False,1,2,1

Sadly today the old players of dota and dota2 have vanished as they have grown older and have jobs....
Today dota2 many servers have been shut down like Indian server,etc.
I was a kid when it launched used to watch my older brother play all day all night.And as years passed i learnt how to play and started playing it...
I loved this game and but i think ice berg and valve should have thought about  making dota3 with something new...but its a controversial topic and ppl might hate me for this. This game has been a truly great moment for moba player for so many years.. As each hero has different abilities, so many freaking  items to buy, each game would bring different outcome and strategy. I miss the old Toxic community xD... This game was no fun for new bies as it was hard to learn all things.
Loved the map as always with great graphics, so many skins,sound packs,etc....The turbo mode  is fun if u wanna try it takes less time for match to get over with... Lastly i  would like to say

You can't type, you can't speak, you can't even hint your teammates more than once per minute or so. Half of your teammates dont know how to play, the other half... you better pray they know. How am I supposed to win matches like that?
Dota 2 was really one of my favorite games all these years... but I can't continue playing in these terms. I even thought about writing a note to Valve but... do I really have to go so far just to enjoy playing this game?

My first match I was under leveled so trying to farm up, my whole team is farming so not much for me. keeping me under leveled. 7 Im lvl 14 and the opposite team is 20. I can't do shit. its clear that we going to loose so our team camps in spawn as do I and i get reported and banned 30 min in my first ever match.
That means if enough people report you then you get banned without review or appeal chance which is bullshit,


So my review is: the game is trash, match making is trash, the report/banning system is trash, the community is trash.

Not New players friendly sadly.",False,508,508,1737473073,False,1,0,0

Dota 2 is an amazing game, no doubt about it. The complexity, variety, and depth make it a masterpiece in its genre. No two matches are ever the same, which keeps things fresh and exciting every time you play. It’s especially fun with friends, where teamwork and coordination can lead to some of the most satisfying victories you’ll ever experience in gaming.

But beware—this game is highly addictive. Once you're in, it’s hard to let go. The thrill of improving, the rush of a good play, and the challenge of outsmarting your opponents create a loop that’s incredibly difficult to break. For me, Dota 2 became more than a game—it was a daily ritual for five years.

However, it’s not all perfect. Playing with strangers can sometimes ruin the experience, especially when someone decides to throw the game or has a bad attitude. And the addictive nature of Dota 2 can make it all-consuming if you’re not careful.

That said, I somehow managed to quit in 2020. Breaking free wasn’t easy, but I’m glad I did. Still, I’ll always respect what this game offers—its unmatched strategy, intense gameplay, and unforgettable moments. If you’re thinking of diving into Dota 2, just be prepared for the time and energy it demands.

TL;DR: A brilliant, highly addictive game that’s best enjoyed with friends. Just know what you’re signing up for before you queue up.",True,127764,0,1737451538,False,8,1,0

Il;'opiIasd123’ve been divorced for a few years now. My ex-wife took our son when we split, and for a long time, I felt like I was missing out on his life. We didn’t live in the same town, and by the time we were in the same city again, things just felt... distant.

One day, I saw him playing this game on his laptop, and I felt this pull. I decided to buy it and give it a shot myself. I spent a few lunch breaks watching tutorials, trying to figure it out.

I didn’t want to just ask him to play with me, so I made a new Steam account and added him, keeping it a secret. When he got online, I invited him to a game. We played for hours, laughing and just enjoying each other's company. The best part? He had no idea it was me.

I could feel that old wall between us starting to break down. We weren’t just father and son – we were friends again. Next time I have him for the weekend, I plan on telling him it was me all along. Wish me luck, guys.

Thanks for helping me reconnect, L4D2 and dota 1 and t dota dotadota2 dota 2 and dota 2 and dota 2.

It seperates toxic players from normal ones.

Simple things like missplays or ""wrong"" items can get you reported.

This makes it incredibly difficult to climb out of low behavior score (below 10k).

Also the game heavily revolves around who can abuse blink dagger more. Such a broken and actually OP item but no one admits it, because it leads to ""cool gameplay"" and ""wombo combo plays"".

From a strategy standpoint is incredible, the amount of skill required and the thousands of possibilities to play the game make it completely unique. The learning curve is tough, so be prepared to have rough times. Becoming good is something you will achieve only after thousands of hours and a lot of tears. 

On the positive side though, the amount of adrenaline it gives you is something almost unmatched to me, even after all these years. 

The worst aspect of this game is unfortunately the community though: IT IS THE MOST TOXIC AND BRAINLESS I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY GAMING LIFE (and I'm not even overreacting, trust me). People here come to throw up all their negativity and hate towards humanity and the entire universe, without holding back.

The game is fun ONLY 1. when skill levels are the same, which no way in hell a dev or AI or any genius can figure out how to measure that. also 2. players must not grief. which they will. because this game is fundamentally frustrating and aggravating.

If you're the type of guy who wants to play for fun and is thinking about playing this game, don't. You will only have a good amount of fun in as many as 1% of your games.
If your competitive then by all means, this is your drug. and probably your doom. depending on how much losing makes you wanna try it even harder. (as you can see 12000 hours is my obsession limit with winning)

Dota 2 is a strategic 5 v 5 online game that promotes complexity and professional gameplay. Its diversity is probably greater than that of any other game you have played before (or maybe even after).
maybe that sounds wild on paper but in truth, it is not practical. let me explain:

1. complexity, diversity, 10 players in a large map of many objectives with free movements, wildly open creativity is an almost limitless pitch of possibilities, which makes new players spend a LOT OF TIME, (again, 12000 hours) learning and mastering the game to rank up or even functionally play the game.
2. for the same reason above players don't have enough self-awareness of the matter that they are in a long LOOOONG period of learning. Therefore they get frustrated and create an increasingly and consistently toxic environment. that's just the way our brain normally works. 
some show a different pattern and try to fix the issue but they lack the info to fix it, so they open their mics (lol) and start discussing it, which ultimately turns into an argument.
Long story short, all the choices each mind makes lead to frustration and anger.
3. When you master the game
 Let's say you even reached the point where you have figured out everything. now you need to spend playing 1000 games to rank up and that's IF valve doesn't upload a new patch which sets you back to square one of finding the new method to ranking up because your old method is probably(almost always) not the strongest anymore. why do you have to play a 1000 game you ask? because you have to win with people who have not mastered it yet, who don't know what you are doing and will make their OWN gameplay. also take into account that the game is frustrating so some players break and do a mental gameplay which means they will die to the enemy and feed them. making them stronger which is not good for you. and also plenty of griefers pick-griefers com-griefers late-griefers DC-griefers and there is also the smurfs. who are they? they my friend are people who mastered the game already, and reached the peak of dota skills. they come with a second ID to either boost that ID and sell their service or they just simply can't win in their own game and simply want to play a match they can so they don't lose any rank/mmr.
and based on statistics your winrate would be somewhere around 45%-55% in a monthly period.
so in short, you need to play 1000 matches after you mastered the game in order to reach high ranks such as immortal. (thats 6000 mmr, you will start from somewhere between 1000-3000, each win gives you 21-28 based on the patch but usually around that range, that is... IF YOU WIN.)
4. newcomers to Dota 2.
although I am sad about this, unfortunately bringing new players to this game has been a challenge for Dota 2 devs. reasons are not clear (meaning there is no reason that everyone seems to agree on), but from a statistical point it is declining over the years for this reason specifically. so, if valve doesn't do something new with its game, the game will die out by the time you learn this game.

Is there a good side to this game?
absolutely.
1. It's competitive and challenging.
2. it is a professional-level game. (a master-not a pro- uses at least 45 key bindings that are used constantly throughout the game. main reason why I think it's top tier.)
3. you will have fun when a match becomes balanced skill-wise, regardless of the situations you get yourself into.
4. Hero characters are well designed and the game is a masterpiece. the idea behind it is a masterpiece and is the Bill Gates of online co-op action RPG ( can't spoil anything if you're still gonna play it after reading this.)

My before dota would recommend this game 100%. 
The current version wants you to not play a beta game that has not fixed the issues mentioned above. especially the one where drafts are not balanced by skill.

76561198047333591,185653803,"Impressions are purely based on nearly 200 unranked games, but by god is Dota 2 one brilliant video game with one incompetent developer and millions of players who don't deserve access to anything made after 19th century.

I wish I could enjoy it because the actual game part is brilliant. It quite the first of its kind, but it definitely defined and popularized it, and it's easy to see why. They took the fun of hero characters in RTS games, amplified it tenfold, and then built a whole game around it. Every match you have a lot of decisions to make that vary drastically based on the state of the game, team compositions, economy, individual player builds and playstyles, etc. Even the characters themselves are so diverse, and I think this is the biggest leg up it has over the competition. Gameplay itself can shift so much from character to character that it's almost understandable why some sickos pick one flavor and the eat nothing but that for thousands of hours.

It's also an almost paradoxical game where both hero and system overall enable a great amount of skill expression, yet proper teamwork and coordination are still important to an extent that you rarely actually see in team based multiplayer games. It's also one game where ""nobody is broken when everyone is"" really does feel accurate. In the right hands and with the right items, pretty much every character can do things that will make you think ""well, that's some bull****,"" yet there is often a powerful counter to it, a way to play around it, or something equally bull that every other character can pull off. Dota 2 *feels* loose in every element of its design, yet when you look closer at any of those elements, you start seeing thin but unbreakable connection that weave the fabric that Dota is made of.

Even in terms of visuals and storytelling I like more about it than I would expect from a MOBA. There's a lot of lore to explore, and while much of it is lacking, and Valve is sort of just sitting on it, it feels like whoever is responsible for putting it all together still cares deeply about the universe that this game is set it, and Crownfall is hopefully first of many examples of what can be done with it. 

The only caveat here is that Valve also has some of the soulless, greediest monetization practices, and very low standards for maintaining the visual integrity of the games they created. All the fine craftsmanship that was put into creating the art style of TF2 was smeared with crap once lootbox money started rolling in. CS mostly resisted this, because cosmetics used to be limited to only weapons, but Dota 2 art style also went down the drain. Anything is permitted, and the more offensively tasteless it looks, the more rare and expensive it is. 

The base characters all have their charm in some way. I understand that they aren't to everyone's taste. Many of them lack maybe one or two features that would make them feel like a ""main character,"" which is something that I feel a lot of hero based games chase after. All of them are just a bit too plain or simple to fit that role. You have dozens of dudes in armor of various colors and sizes, but it weirdly appeals to me that no individual character feels too ""special"" I guess? 

That was all thrown out the moment Valve smelled money. Now you can spend an unreasonable amount of money in order to turn your unremarkable mook into a high level MU Online whale. It's funny because Valve still has those brilliant cosmetics guidelines for people who want to make something, but they haven't cares about what is said there for years. Silhouettes? Who cares. Glance value? Dude, just remember that this pile of pixels is Sniper. The arcanas are especially offensive, because they advertise extra crap as a selling point. Most Dota 2 chars emit zero lights or particles, some sets will give you clouds, glowing gems, arcs of lightning, buzzling flies or orbiting stars, excess is the goal over something coherent or appealing, and the community happily eats it up. Perhaps they don't even care about the look, since all of this is connected to the real money marketplace that enables gambling addicts, whales, and kids who think they can make money by playing their favorite video game.

Anyway, Valve happily enabling gambling aside, one of the main things that makes this game harder to enjoy is the quality of matchmaking and moderation. I have a succesful griefing report for pretty much every single day that I played, and to give you an idea, that doesn't even include a case where we had a willow that stood AFK in the fountain and sent our her courier to die, I guess that didn't count or something. Griefers would be one thing, but there's also so many accounts that are merely days old but obviously aren't remotely new to Dota. If it all it takes to avoid smurf que is to occasionally throw a game, then I'm not sure Valve understands the point of smurf que. Finally even ignoring these two points that already ruin 90% of my matches, the game loves to put new and old players together. I don't care if MMR is similar, a Zeus with 12k wins will be stronger than (non-smurfing) Zeus qith 20 games under their belt, it makes no sense to not take player count into account.

Maybe ranked would've resolved some of my woes, but you need 100 in-game hours to even gain access to that. It took me well over 150 matches to get to that point. I'm not sure if Dota players understand this, but the point of ranked isn't just to stroke your ego and to achieve the highest number/icon possible. It's there to enable fair matches between equally matched opponents. If someone is new and bad, they will be put up against other new and bad players, that's good.

""But it keeps smurfs out"" please reconsider even attempting to think that this makes sense. More dedicated smurfs are buying accounts and paying boosters to get whatever they want, Valve is exceptionally bad at handling that too. More stingy ones are then thrown into unranked with players who could've been playing ranked, and I'm not sure too many of them are willing to endure low quality matches for 100 hours before they are allowed to experience something more tolerable. It's really a shame. Under more caring developer, Dota 2 could've been a fantastic experience.",False,20669,5399,1736957557,False,7,0,2

i really enjoyed my first day back...but...not enjoying as much right now :(( but its not cuz its not a good game...it has
best client that i've ever played with, music is ok, the gameplay is insanely good! very satisfying when you win and
it constantly drives you to strive to get better! there's just one little problem...*(some members of the community)*
i'm not going to generalize and say it's everybody but there's too many!! too many people that you're playing with in solo/ranked that just don't know how to have a good time anymore...there people are afraid of failure :( they don't know that it's sometimes ok to lose...*(main goal is to have fun!)*
well too many times some of the games that i play in has people on my team that i just feel like ""i don't want them to win""...they're acting like toxic a**hole!...and i don't feel like they deserve the win even if we still might be able to get it.
dota 2 is 10 out of 10 when the community sometimes can be quite disappointing...i should avoid not to generalize because there's a lot of players that i've met and it was so much fun playing with them <3
what i don't miss is people giving up at first blood...what i don't miss is people calling each other  dog s**t :(
the moment i see someone on my team that's actively try to lose! :| starting to use their abilities in a grief way because they felt that there was an infraction against them by me or by anyone...
I saw this kind of behavior And I said to myself, I can handle it and I can deal with it, but my interest level in playing the game properly and my mood levels drop quite a lot...
If you want to start this game, I suggest that you don't start at all! you can really spend our time in a better way...But if you really insist...prepare yourself to be yelled at for playing :) sometimes pre muting evryone is a great strategy! :) btw it's not good for your mental health :)
Thank you for taking the time to read <3

 Its a 

""I dont know anything, I will try to learn the game, OH but get one shotted by everything, stunned by everything and just get flamed by others"" 

kind of game.(league of legends is also like that but learning is easy)


-The mechanics also are really ugly and hard to use. For example you have to press space twice( when you let go it you have to quick press double time again) and hold it so your character so the screen is centered while pressing keyboard buttons to use abilities than items for numbers and moving your mouse so you can do Attack Damage. 

-Why does every character have to do attack damage while you can just use abilities? I dont understand. 

-I loved Muerte it looked really cool, with that I have to bring it half of the characters look like it has been taken from a Dungeons and dragons book. the character names are pretty much basic like ORC HUNTER or WIZARD or DEAD KING. Like bro, couldnt you guys find creative names while having this much complicated usage of items and controls?

-It wants me to pick more than one character and play like its a Civilization 4 game (BUT 100000000 TIMES MORE STUFF GOING ON LIVE ON YOUR SCREEN) so you might get epilepsy or something.

-screen is so small to see stuff around you.

-I dont understand the logic of vision in this game, why do I have to break some trees so I can get vision?

-I tried it once before I did like it on playing against bots but playing against people that have thousands of hours in this game? NO. I want new people like me.

I would recommend playing league of legends instead of this. 

If you are a fan of moba, there you will learn it very easily. The community also have beautifull people that carries the game like Druttut and Zwag for you to chill and watch fun things.
 And there is bad people there too but at least its unlike this game you can have some fun messing around. For my 3rd game I got 30 minute of ban in leauge that happens after like billion time of you leaving the game. 30 MINUTES BAN like, what do you mean??

76561198992233420,184698767,"Dota 2, a game celebrated for its depth and strategic complexity, has long been a pillar of competitive gaming. However, the player experience is often marred by significant issues that remain unaddressed by the game's developers, Valve Corporation. Chief among these problems is the prevalence of bought accounts, which disrupt the integrity of matchmaking and foster a toxic environment.

The Issue of Bought Accounts
In Dota 2, the Matchmaking Rating (MMR) system is designed to pair players of similar skill levels. Unfortunately, the widespread practice of buying accounts has undermined this system. High-skill players often purchase low-ranked accounts to dominate less experienced opponents, while low-skill players buy higher-ranked accounts for prestige. This leads to unfair matches, with players struggling to compete in games where their opponents or teammates are significantly out of place skill-wise.

Toxicity in the Community
The mismatch caused by account buying contributes to Dota 2's notorious reputation for player toxicity. Frustration stemming from uneven games often manifests in verbal abuse, griefing, and an overall hostile atmosphere. While toxicity isn't unique to Dota 2, the game's steep learning curve and reliance on teamwork make it especially vulnerable to this issue. Players who feel trapped in matches with ""smurfs"" or unqualified teammates often express their discontent in ways that worsen the experience for everyone involved.

Lack of Action by Valve
Despite community outcry, Valve has done little to combat these issues effectively. Mechanisms like stricter account verification, enhanced detection of smurfing, or harsher penalties for toxicity are either insufficient or entirely absent. The absence of meaningful interventions has left many long-time players disillusioned and frustrated, feeling that the developers are not prioritizing the integrity of the game's competitive environment.

The game is not as complicated as it initially appears, but it provides a extremely horrible learning experience for anyone trying to get into the game, even for people who come from other MOBAs, it simply takes too much time for a person to get engaged into this game, and when you do, it doesn't end up feeling rewarding and often times you're left frustrated by your teammates more than you can carry, then we have the blatant account boosters/sellers ruining high MMR gameplay. Don't think i even have to get into the Russian memes either.

Hero design is quite frankly generic, uninteresting and most characters are just pretty average RPG designs, it's hard to find yourself invested into them even with hours of gameplay, which is a big deal because you're playing a MOBA.

Gameplay pace is slower than most MOBAs on the market in this day and age, and it's really difficult to find people on voice comms that aren't being annoying little pricks. This game may be one of the most well-known MOBA franchises, but it's certainly past it's time. To top it all off, i can not support DOTA+, having basic gameplay features locked behind a subscription on a game is just stupid. I just don't think this game is a game, it's almost like taking a second job with a lot of courses and fees attached to it with no pay, you end up feeling like a large span of your time and life is wasted after you look back.

Dota 2, despite its initial promise and massive following, has several significant issues that detract from the overall gaming experience. One of the most glaring problems is the steep learning curve. New players are often overwhelmed by the complexity of the game, with countless heroes, items, and mechanics that can take years to fully understand. This complexity can be a major barrier to entry for new players looking to get into the game.

The community aspect of Dota 2 is another area that leaves much to be desired. The game's reliance on teamwork means that a single poorly performing or toxic player can ruin an entire match. The prevalence of flaming, blaming, and harassment can make the game unenjoyable, especially for newcomers. This toxic environment often deters players from wanting to engage with the community.

Furthermore, the constant updates and changes to the game can sometimes feel disorienting. While updates are necessary to keep the game fresh, frequent changes to heroes and items can make it challenging to stay competitive and require constant adaptation. This can be frustrating for players who prefer a more stable and consistent gameplay experience.

The matchmaking system in Dota 2 also leaves much to be desired. There are often long wait times, particularly for players in certain regions, and the skill disparities between players can be vast. This can lead to unbalanced and unenjoyable matches where victory feels less satisfying because of the uneven playing field.

In conclusion, while Dota 2 offers a rich and deep gameplay experience, its steep learning curve, toxic community, frequent changes, and inconsistent matchmaking can make it a challenging game to truly enjoy.

76561198088667274,184045128,"DOTA is one of the best online multiplayer strategy games, which has so much depth to its mechanics in contrast to similar games. An average rank game takes 20 to 45+ minutes. It's okay to lose a couple of games due to skill differences, crucial mistakes, misplays, or even someone griefing (proly having a bad day), DC/abandoning the game. We learn and re-queue next to have a better experience than the last and try our best to win and finally, hope our proper grinding is rewarded. In my opinion, this is the basic idea behind any multiplayer game that improves longevity and quality of life.

Unfortunately, this is not the case with SEA DOTA (7.5k hours of experience; it could be similar in other regions), especially in solo rank, 90%( I AM EXAGGERATING CZ UM TILTED FROM THE RECENT 50 GAMES) of the ranked games are either griefing or have someone (sometimes 1 or 2) who is not skilled enough for a certain rank. Within that 90%, you have to play near perfect with minimum mistakes to barely get a win. BY ALL MEANS, I'm an average skilled player who loves Dota (played since 2006 (Dota 1 & 2)). From what I understand, the game is made so that a single person cannot win the entire game by himself ( unlike FPS, where you can skill diff and 1v5). And to talk about that 10%, particularly when playing a party, no matter win or lose, it's AWESOME! BODACIOUS! DOPE!, LIT!, FLY!, BUSSIN!, FIRE!, whatever the GENZ term.

So, in summary, you'll lose more than you win especially when you solo, which will reduce your rank, and you'll end up playing with lower ranks and get accustomed to it and lose more until you say, F##K RANK! No new player will grind cz of the learning curve , proly quit and play LOL or something.

FYI : I'm not talking about the smurfing phase where you cruise through the lower ranks.I'm talking about the ranks where winning requires some degree of teamwork.

TIP : If you must solo queue, GO play EU/AUS or any other server (Atleast those mfs will TRY to communicate)

76561198799718431,183948626,"Dota 2 is a deeply flawed game that often leaves players feeling frustrated and disconnected from the enjoyment they’re hoping to get. The steep learning curve makes it daunting for newcomers, with no real in-game tutorial or guidance, forcing players to rely on external resources just to understand the basics. The complexity of the heroes, items, and strategies can quickly become overwhelming, and even after hours of practice, progress feels minimal. The game’s long, drawn-out matches—often lasting 40 minutes or more—can be draining, especially when a single mistake can snowball into an unavoidable defeat. Furthermore, Dota 2’s lack of a clear progression system leaves players without tangible rewards or a sense of achievement, making it easy to feel like you're wasting your time. The constant need for teamwork and coordination also means that if your team isn’t playing well, you’re likely to lose regardless of your individual performance. With all its intricacies, slow pace, and repetitive gameplay, Dota 2 often feels like a punishing grind rather than an enjoyable experience. This game is the biggest piece of garbage.

76561199809530840,183903517,"Dota 2 is a well made game and a fun addition to the MOBA genre, however various aspects of the game that don't really relate to the gameplay itself impact my enjoyment of it. 

The matchmaking system is poorly designed. 100 hours of causal matches is required before being able to play ranked games, which means you'd be playing 200+ casual games. That's an absurdly high wall to force players to climb. There's also a new player friendly mode that makes matches easier for new players, however none of the games you play in that mode contribute to the ranked requirement. I think a casual mode for players of all skill levels works just fine for everyone, a ""new player"" mode feels a bit extra. 

Also, loading into games always takes a long time, which isn't great.

Toxicity in online gaming is a tale as old as time and is a problem across the board. I found it to be pretty prevalent in Dota 2, especially in casual matches; I've had multiple games in which not only were other players really toxic in chat and voice, but in gameplay as well. Players get frustrated at their lane for some reason and straight up ditch their positions to play elsewhere, essentially throwing the game and ruining things for everyone. I wouldn't bring these things up if it was a one time thing, however I've found it to happen multiple times and it took a toll on me. 

The game feels unneccesarily harder to understand compared to the likes of League of Legends. It feels like almost every single player in League knows how to play the game and teach you how to play it, while in Dota it felt like most people didn't. Maybe that's a consequence of playing casual games, it's not like I'd be able to play ranked without pouring 100 hours of casual in game matches first. Maybe it's a consequence of this game not being as well optimized for introducing people, maybe it's a consequence of this game being less popular than League. I'm no expert on any of these things, I'm just spit-balling.

The gameplay itself is genuinely fun and I'm sure, even though I had a hard time understanding things, that the game is well made and takes skill to master. However, external aspects of the game ruin my passion to get into it. Mastering champions takes forever, loading times for matches can be long, toxicity amongst players takes a toll, the climb towards ranked is absurd, DOTA Plus is not a great service on paper and in execution, the community and Dota 2 as a brand just doesn't have the same stuff going for it that League does and that affects people's enjoyment and likelihood to play it a lot. 

These are just my opinions, I don't hate this game and these issues I've pointed out aren't too difficult to fix given Valve's resources. I've had my fun moments, it's just time for me to play different games.

500 long hours and it finally broke me.

This is the most bloated, convoluted, excessively complicated game ever created. You have to be a f**ing lawyer to play this. Most of the text is waaaaaaaaaaaay too small, too. The visual clutter is a mess.

Balancing is better than most of its genre, but still things slip through the cracks, like Phantom Lancer rapidly making 20 clones with no counter play, Phantom Assassin 2 shotting people with 1 item, or Bristle Back who only needs some speed and hp regen to literally sit in your spawn and 1v5 your team.

I thought League of Legends was bad about games going on too long, but mother of mercy, THESE MATCHES CAN GO ON FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS!! Don't you think after the 30 min mark, it's time for some sudden death mechanic and wrap this s** up???

Edit: Speaking of LoL, about a year ago, Riot updated it with an 

""""""""""""""anti cheat""""""""""""""

called Vanguard. It was already a colossal failure in their other title Valorant. It was a tornadoe of issues for legit customers - including bricking their PC's - and did nothing to stop the cheaters. Riot is also 100% owned by Tencent which is China's Silicon Valley. It's been proven to be some of the most intrusive spyware there ever was. I haven't touched league since. Below is a guy that was also a league maniac and was uploading on the daily. He quit league too, and he sheds light on the situation like no one else has.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wygeFoZQCOk

But enough about league; let's get back to those loooong matches.

They tried to solve this with Turbo Mode where most things are sped up, including ending a game in 30min (THANK CHRIST!!!), but here is also where DOTA fails most of all.

Every match is the same bulls***. Pick whoever you want, it won't matter. The announcer is tweaking out about how your teammates are constantly dying. It's not unusual to have teammates go something like 0/8, 0/15, 2/19, and 0/26. Now that Sniper, Bristle, Phantom Lancer/Assassin have that many kills, they are unstoppably fed. You now can do nothing but sit in your base and sloooowly wait to lose for the next 25 min because there's nothing 
-NOTHING- you can do now. Rinse and repeat game after game after game after game until you're fed up. 

It's not really Valve's fault, its this dumb**s community. If you're going to run out of spawn, m2 the first red hp bar, and mash your buttons, go play WoW. Go play COD. I have 2 very, very, very low standards for my teammates. In phase 1) farm, don't feed. 2) group, and fight. That's it. That is all I ask from these teammates and they fail miserably.

DOTA itself has loads of potential and is horrendously addictive, but I'd steer clear unless you need it to absorb your life. I'll unfortunately have to keep playing it. The other option is to drop $800 on the latest console so I can play the over-hyped, marketing-budget-splurging, flavor-of-the-month shooter like Halo: Multiverse Addition, where Master Chief is an obese black bisexual woman who can do no wrong, has every answer, and lectures the white cast about a narrow-sighted view of a cherry-picked slave trade no one is alive to remember.",False,38667,156,1734401591,False,3,0,1

Than you will want to play the hero you know against more advanced players but you will find that about a 3rd of the heroes are banned, and the heroes that are banned are allways different. so you hardly ever get to practice with the hero you want to practice with, so you will be stuck playing some hero you don't know and you will just get killed the whole game by people who learned all the heroes back in a time when you could play games with any hero you wanted. Than if you leave these games even twice you can no longer play any games, so when you are stuck playing a hero you don't know it is tieing up your computer for 45 min.

Pros: 
· Nice graphics
· Character kits and abilities feel very smooth.
· Right click pathing feels better than LoL but you can't hold down right click to move in a direction.

Cons:
· Comically weak towers but that's just a different play style to get used to so not really a con.
· Odd game design choices with lot of dedicated buttons missing like camera lock.
· A guide is needed to figure out how to surrender and also shit load of conditions to actually surrender.
· Absolute clusterfuck of an UI. Like who actually designed this. It's an early 2000s UI stuck in the 90s. Only pro to it is that it's very information heavy so maybe once you figure out how to navigate it, it can be helpful. Even then would not change the fact that the UI looks like something from a game in alpha or running in debug mode when developing it.
· Lot of random extra mechanics (even before game starts) compared to other MOBAs which just makes it feel like an RTS again.
· I get that Dota was originally a mod for WOW 3 but every character design is just a WOW character and not in a good way.

In conclusion, I now think LoL has a good UI and that HotS should've taken over Dota as the other top down MOBA. Would just not recommend this to anyone trying to play a new MOBA. This is another genre of a game within itself. Try out Smite or Predecessor (Paragon) before this.",False,181,0,1733566572,False,0,0,0

76561198064270537,181915287,"Ran out of space and I'm not going to allow comments to write more there bcs that just gonna invite toxic ppl from this game so I'm just gonna shorten my essay into some points.

It's an unbalanced game relying on OP items and characters. Who deletes who first. Develop a bs strategy to counter a countering you enemy bs strategy. If everyone and everything is OP then it's balanced?, no, everything and everyone are still OP.

CC. In other games 0.5s short situational CC with 1.5-2s longer team fight oriented CC are the norm, in here 5s are the norm, most characters got one or more CC, items can just casually 5s silence you. The CC can perma stun you without chaining for some characters requiring a passive item or an ally to save you and even if most characters being unable to perma stun the CC is still ridiculously long and can be chained. The CC is mostly 5s with some being shorter and some longer (for example, character I played, Winter Wyvern, can CC entire enemy team for up to 7s forcing them to kill a character of my choosing). Most abilities and all items are click and do, skill shots are very rare meaning they require no skill, you just press the button. It's perfectly ""fine"" for the devs that you might be unable to play your character or make someone else unable to for the entirety of the match.

Damage is off the charts, you can quite easily kill someone 1v1 or do a big chunk of their hp at least with a button press, imagine what an entire team can do to you, it's just ""poof"". Compare that to other mobas where you need to be fed, have full build, multiple levels over, actually have to hit the enemy with skill shots on top of just having a strong role/hero.

Back to OP characters, all of them are OP but some are more than others and you might see them nearly every game unless you play ranked where they get banned instead nearly every game.

Enormous range easily dwarfing other mobas by giving your basic attacks and abilities double, sometimes triple and quadruple range over what other mobas allow, it's perfectly common to be hit by stuff across the screen or even off-screen.

Towers don't protect you, if you tower dive in LoL or HoTS for example you can be sure that unless it's end game some if not all the tower divers will get deleted, in here the towers literally tickle you, you can even at lvl 1 go chase an enemy and you never get to feel safe due to tower, better have a strong team or teleport away, tower means nothing. Same with fountain, in LoL you will get deleted in moments even as a tank, in here you can just walk in there and it's just a rapid firing tower and nothing else, tanks might stay there even permanently and if you got some ways of using that damage/hits taken (like Bristleback for example) then you can even kill ppl with their own fountain.

The game is obviously also extremely toxic, the stereotype is fully true, you will find yourself reporting someone at least every second match and you don't even need to be the target, I was insulted like twice or so but the amount of hate between the others, griefing and ruining the game just doesn't compare to other mobas, LoL is a kindergarden compared to this. There's also a reason why other mobas eventually decide to turn off chat between teams, bcs it's just roasting and insults fiesta bcs ppl want to feel better than others shouting at their screens like some chimps, in here Valve never learned to turn that off and the punishments are just silencing and lower queue priority, aka, they can tell you to kys and no one is going to ban them, ever. Better yet, they encourage toxicity with voice chat, between teams chat, visual taunts and Dota Plus exclusive wheel where you can select voice lines to spam, you can turn most of that off right from the start but they will still feel empowered to do so in your ignorance on top of them still being perfectly able to taunt you with high fives, fountain camping, playing around with food and even living in your fountain, I've seen it happen done by allies and opponents alike and I got only few hours.

Itemization is poor, very little and most are just stat sticks. Also extremely expensive on top of having extremely boring design. You will find yourself building same things for a lot of characters. BKB for example is a culprit, nearly everyone will have it as their second or third item. There's like 3 armor and 2 magic armor items.

Blink Dagger exists (that's a negative). Imagine the flash skill from LoL, now imagine a 15 seconds CD only, screen wide instant teleport just like that. I understand that some characters can't function well without it but that's devs problem, learn to give characters with shorter range ways to engage other than screen wide teleport followed by deleting whoever you teleported to. The only counter to it is to have even longer range to hit them and disable it for 3 seconds coupled with both ward types to even see them waiting. It also limits item choices bcs just like BKB this becomes mandatory for some.

Jungle is fascinating and amazing, not everything is bad and evil, you help yourself, you help the team, everyone can do it, everyone should do it and there's even mechanics like camp stacking. The map is very fun compared to the puke boring LoL one for example. Trees can also be interacted with, you can destroy them, use them as a weapon, throw them, you can even plant or eat them.

Neutral items for extra customization to alleviate some of the boredom of itemization, most cool stuff is here, sadly it's rng what you get from the token but you always gonna get something nice in the end from them.

You can deny a tower, no, you can deny a kill even. My teammate once denied me, that's some next level 5head stuff.

Town scrolls allowing you to teleport around on a one minute CD and only interruptable by hard stuns.

Very pleasing visually.

Has an actual dragon (wyvern) instead of some disney garbage or anime, humanoid hybrids, nearly all other games are either about slaying them or ""being one"", aka, have horn and some scales on cheeks and that's it bcs humans love to cum to more humans.

I will of course get some more hours after the review (I was gifted the wyvern skin after all) but preferably something I care about releases so I can switch focus.",False,4084,0,1733354849,False,1,0,0

I was lucky that when I reported one cheater, the overwatchers banned him after 2 days. He was game banned. Just 1 out of dozens blatant cheaters - maphackes, auto last hitters, auto creep blockers, items/abilities scripters, aegis snatchers... They can also see your private profiles and your match history before connecting to the match. If they see a strong enemy team - they just click to dodge the match and the script just dodges the match without penalty even when the cheater clicks to accept the match.

ruzzian guilds with nazi profile pictures, promoting war, hate speech and racism. Toxic ruzzians going afk and destroying items after dying two times in a row. Behavior systyem is not working.  EU servers are filled with ruzzians who report non-ruzzian speaking players for no reason. Regional channels are full of bots promoting cheat and boosting websites. The New player channel is not moderated. 

Gameplay - 10/10 - very fun and competitive.
Toxicity - 100/10 - too many toxic players and griefers. Almost no penalty.
Anti-cheat - What? Good joke/10 - no anti-cheat. Only cheaters with throwaway rage cheating accounts are banned by Overwatch reviewers. AND IT'S VERY VERY RARE. Getting banned for cheating is rarer than unboxing a very rare item.

76561199010492001,180259625,"As a long-time Dota 2 player, I’ve seen the game evolve, but one issue that continues to plague the community is smurfing. For those unfamiliar, smurfing refers to experienced players creating new accounts to play against less skilled opponents, often leading to unbalanced matches and a frustrating experience for everyone involved.

When I first started playing Dota 2, I was excited to learn and improve. However, my enjoyment quickly diminished as I found myself frequently matched against smurf accounts. These players, often with thousands of hours of experience, dominate the game, making it nearly impossible for newer players to have a fair chance. Instead of a learning experience, matches become one-sided and discouraging.

The matchmaking system seems to struggle to account for these smurf accounts, leading to a toxic environment where new players feel overwhelmed and veterans feel unchallenged. It’s disheartening to see the same players repeatedly crush the hopes of those trying to enjoy the game and improve their skills.

Moreover, the community suffers as a result. New players are often driven away from the game due to the frustration of being outmatched, which ultimately leads to a decline in the player base. It’s a vicious cycle that could be mitigated if smurfing were addressed more seriously by the developers.

In conclusion, while Dota 2 is an incredible game with a rich competitive scene, the prevalence of smurfing significantly detracts from the overall experience. I hope the developers take action to create a more balanced and fair matchmaking system, allowing all players to enjoy the game as it was intended. Until then, I can’t recommend Dota 2 to new players looking for a welcoming environment.",False,87667,3,1732772026,False,0,0,0

76561198357508832,179877770,"I want the old DotA 2 back, with Enigma in the jungle (yes that used to be a role sometimes people played) and supports not having infinite poke potential without at least five clarity's in their inventory.

I have spent more than 4 thousand hours in this game and not once have I felt like DotA 2's balance system was just, but now they are trying to be, with health buffs every single hero received you will never ever see a rampage in this game unless extraordinary circumstances like extreme level difference calls for it, not even in the late game.

While trying to make everyone more happy and spend less time staring at their respawn timer, they've made no one happy, because tank heroes are either fully useless due to lack of damage or someone else having equal HP to them and not being a tank, and those who are squishy no longer are which creates problems for carries because they wont execute their targets in time, or they will kill everyone and survive because they are also rocking a lot of HP both inherently and from items they buy which has HP or STR stat shoe horned into it somewhere.

Some characters have also received completely new passives which alter their gameplay severely, sometimes both of these innate abilities are not of use, making it seem like they have nothing at all against those who have gotten entirely new kits revolving around their new non-active abilities, and at other times, there are no passives to begin with, meaning that an already existing part of the character is taken out of their active ability and is now called their new passive, which obviously is not fun if you are planning to duel a character who has more abilities to use than you.

And finally, DotA 2 used to be a game of fundamentals; core knowledge of mechanics, map awareness, and micro/macro was the essence and is now replaced with a game either going fully your way, or being a stomp with little comeback potential as literally everyone is so freaking immortal with loads and loads of HP, freely being able to tank even the toughest turrets without a care on squishy characters, and being able to melt buildings because the enemy poke wont matter in the end since you will outlive the barracks or the towers since the heroes somehow have more HP and defense buffs now than what used to be the hardest objectives to ever breach into; the high ground.

While I had an immeasurable amounts of fun and an unspeakable amount of pure hatred while playing this game, it's no longer really there, you can't even one shot people anymore, what happened to clips with SF, PA or Sven's taking double rampage in under 20 minute mark? What happened to fighting Rosh pit super early on without no clear reason to keep contesting it?

I am not even a high-elo player, I have played exclusively unranked for the majority of my play time and when I did play rank, it was almost as low as the game would let me, I'm saying this because even people in the lowest ranks don't know how to have fun anymore, and I don't mean the toxicity, it's just tucked away, Roshan pit, deep corner jungle maps and tormentor, they are all encouraging a slow burn, it's just... not fun.

I want to play it like it's 2016, but it's gone now, and after +4K hours of my life put into this game, all I can say is I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.",False,246659,0,1732663387,False,0,0,0

Also the tutorials weren't that great.  It would be nice if it paused the game when it threw pop-ups at you to read and soak up instead of letting the battle continue behind it, that let's your hero get killed .  I didn't understand the courier tut at all. It made no sense and when I clicked the things it told me to click, half the time nothing happened.  I learned nothing from it.
